        **GenderAI Classifier** is an innovative application that leverages the power of artificial intelligence to predict gender from images. 
        The application uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG-16 architecture, which is well-known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks.
        
        ### Key Features:
        - **High Accuracy**: The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 97% on test data.
        - **User-Friendly**: Simply upload an image, and the application will predict the gender in seconds.
        - **Real-World Applications**: This technology can be used in various fields such as security, marketing, and social media.

        ### How It Works:
        1. **Upload an Image**: Choose a photo similar to a passport-size photo for best results.
        2. **Prediction**: The image is processed and analyzed by the CNN model.
        3. **Result**: The predicted gender is displayed.

        ### Technical Details:
        - **Model Architecture**: VGG-16 Convolutional Neural Network.
        - **Training Data**: The model was trained on a diverse dataset of male and female images.
        - **Performance**: The model was fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance and accuracy.

        ### Developer:
        Created by Venkatesh, this application showcases the potential of AI in everyday tasks. Feel free to reach out for collaborations or inquiries.
